# Assignment 1
CS 522 Assignment 1 submission for Bradford Smith.

There is not much to report on for this assignment as it was to follow the
tutorial
[(https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/)](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/).
I had no issues following the tutorial and have successfully run the completed
app.  Rather than the tutorial's suggested `example.com`, I chose to use
`cs522.stevens.edu` as the domain for the project. Other than that and replacing
the app name with "Bradford Smith's First App" my code should not differ much
from the tutorial code.

For the testing video (provided in `cs522_assignment1_recording.mp4`) I simply
tried two different inputs in the first activity to show that the second one
would properly update the displayed text.
