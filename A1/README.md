# Assignment 1
CS 522 Assignment 1 submission for Bradford Smith.

There is not much to report on for this assignment as it was to follow a
tutorial.  I had no issues following the tutorial and have successfully run the
completed app. Rather than the tutorial's suggested `example.com`, I chose to
use `cs522.stevens.edu` as the domain for the project. Other than that and
replacing the app name with "Bradford Smith's First App" my code should not
differ much from the tutorial code.
